				{
					question: 'How much should I spend on my first pickleball paddle?',
					answer:
						"For your first paddle, we recommend spending between $60-$100. This price range offers good quality without breaking the bank while you're still learning the game. The Onix Z5 Graphite or Gamma Fusion LE are excellent starter options that will serve you well as you develop your skills.",
				},
				{
					question:
						'What is the difference between graphite and carbon fiber paddles?',
					answer:
						'Graphite paddles are lighter and offer better touch and control, making them popular for finesse players. Carbon fiber paddles are more durable and provide slightly more power and spin potential. Carbon fiber is also stiffer, which can generate more pop. Many modern paddles use variations or combinations of both materials.',
				},
				{
					question: 'How often should I replace my pickleball paddle?',
					answer:
						'With regular play (3-4 times per week), a quality paddle should last 1-2 years. Signs you need a replacement include dead spots in the sweet spot, visible cracks or delamination, edge guard damage, or noticeable performance degradation. Tournament players may replace paddles more frequently to maintain peak performance.',
				},
				{
					question: 'Does paddle weight really matter?',
					answer:
						'Yes, paddle weight significantly impacts your game. Lighter paddles (7.0-7.5oz) offer better maneuverability and are easier on the arm but generate less power. Heavier paddles (8.0-8.5oz) provide more power and stability but can cause fatigue. Most players find their sweet spot in the 7.8-8.2oz range.',
				},
				{
					question: 'Are expensive paddles worth it for beginners?',
					answer:
						"Not necessarily. While premium paddles offer advanced features and materials, beginners won't fully appreciate or utilize these benefits. Start with a quality mid-range paddle ($60-$100) and upgrade once you've developed your skills and understand your playing style preferences.",
				},
				{
					question: 'Can I use tennis grip tape on my pickleball paddle?',
					answer:
						'Yes, tennis overgrips work perfectly on pickleball paddles and are a popular customization. They can increase grip size, improve comfort, and provide better moisture absorption. Many players experiment with different grip materials to find what feels best for their game.',
