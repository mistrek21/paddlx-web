		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 2,
		question: 'When will I be charged for my booking?',
		answer:
			"Payment is processed immediately when you confirm your booking. For tournaments and events with registration fees, you'll be charged upfront to secure your spot. Coaching sessions are paid at the time of booking.",
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 3,
		question: 'Is my payment information secure?',
		answer:
			'Yes. All payment information is encrypted and processed through Stripe, a PCI-DSS Level 1 certified payment processor. We never store your complete card details on our servers.',
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 4,
		question: 'What are the transaction fees?',
		answer:
			'paddlX charges a small platform fee of 2.9% + â‚±15 per transaction to cover payment processing costs. This fee is included in the total amount you see at checkout.',

	// Payment Failures
	{
		id: 5,
		question: 'Why was my payment declined?',
		answer:
			'Payments can be declined for several reasons: insufficient funds, expired card, incorrect card details (number, CVV, or expiration date), card restrictions by your bank, or exceeding your card limit. Contact your bank or card issuer for specific information about the decline.',
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 6,
		question: 'My payment failed but I was charged. What should I do?',
		answer:
			"If your payment failed but you see a charge on your account, don't worry. This is typically a temporary authorization hold that will be released by your bank within 3-5 business days. If the charge doesn't disappear after 7 days, contact us with your transaction details.",
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 7,
		question: "What does 'insufficient funds' mean?",
		answer:
			"This means your card or account doesn't have enough money to complete the transaction. Check your account balance and try again, or use a different payment method.",
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 8,
		question:
			'My card keeps getting declined even though I have enough money. Why?',
		answer:
			"Even with sufficient funds, payments can fail if: your card issuer flagged the transaction as suspicious, your card doesn't support online/international transactions, you've exceeded daily transaction limits, or your billing address doesn't match. Contact your bank to authorize the transaction.",
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 9,
		question: "I'm getting an error message. What do I do?",
		answer:
			"Try these steps: 1) Double-check all card details are correct, 2) Ensure your card hasn't expired, 3) Try a different payment method, 4) Clear your browser cache and try again, 5) Check your internet connection. If problems persist, contact support with a screenshot of the error.",
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},

	// GCash & Digital Wallets
	{
		id: 10,
		question: 'How do I pay with GCash?',

		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 11,
		question: 'My GCash payment failed. What should I check?',
		answer:
			"Common GCash payment issues: insufficient GCash wallet balance, exceeded monthly transaction limit, GCash account not fully verified, poor internet connection, or GCash app/servers experiencing issues. Try restarting the GCash app, checking your balance, and ensuring you're fully verified.",
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 12,
		question: 'Can I get a refund to my GCash wallet?',

	// Refunds & Cancellations
	{
		id: 13,

		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 14,
		question: 'When will I receive my refund?',
		answer:
			'Once a refund is approved, it typically takes 5-10 business days to appear in your account. The exact timing depends on your bank or payment provider. Digital wallet refunds (GCash, PayMaya) are usually faster than credit card refunds.',
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 15,
		question: 'Why was I charged a cancellation fee?',
		answer:
			'Cancellation fees are set by event organizers, coaches, or venue owners according to their cancellation policy. These fees help cover administrative costs and compensate for last-minute cancellations. Always review the cancellation policy before booking.',
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 16,
		question: 'Can I get a full refund if I cancel?',
		answer:
			'Full refund eligibility depends on when you cancel and the specific cancellation policy for your booking. Generally, cancellations made well in advance (24-48 hours) have better refund terms. Check the cancellation policy displayed at checkout.',
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},

	// Disputes & Chargebacks
	{
		id: 17,
		question: "I don't recognize a charge on my statement. What should I do?",
		answer:
			"First, check your paddlX booking history to verify the transaction. Charges appear as 'paddlX' or 'STRIPE*paddlX' on your statement. If you still don't recognize it, contact us immediately before filing a dispute with your bank.",
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 18,
		question: 'How do I dispute a charge?',
		answer:
			"Before filing a chargeback with your bank, please contact paddlX support first. We can often resolve issues faster than the formal dispute process. If you've already contacted your bank, they'll investigate and contact us for evidence. The process takes 30-90 days.",
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 19,
		question: 'What happens if I file a chargeback?',
		answer:
			"Filing a chargeback initiates a formal investigation. Your bank will temporarily refund the amount while investigating. We'll provide evidence (booking confirmations, communications, service delivery proof) to your bank. False chargebacks may result in account restrictions.",
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},

	// Tournament & Event Payments
	{
		id: 20,
		question: 'Do I need to pay upfront for tournaments?',
		answer:
			'Yes, tournament registration typically requires upfront payment to secure your spot. This ensures commitment and helps organizers plan accordingly. Some tournaments may offer payment plans for higher entry fees.',
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 21,
		question: 'What happens if a tournament is cancelled?',
		answer:
			"If an organizer cancels a tournament, you'll automatically receive a full refund to your original payment method within 5-10 business days. You'll be notified via email and in-app notification.",
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 22,
		question: 'Can I transfer my tournament entry to someone else?',
		answer:
			'Entry transfer policies vary by tournament. Contact the tournament organizer directly to inquire about transfers. Some may allow it with no fee, others may charge an administrative fee, and some may not permit transfers at all.',
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},

	// Coaching & Lessons
	{
		id: 23,
		question: 'When do I pay for coaching sessions?',
		answer:
			"Payment is required at the time of booking to secure your coaching session. This ensures both your and the coach's commitment to the scheduled time.",
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 24,
		question: 'What if I need to cancel a coaching session?',
		answer:
			"Cancellation policies are set by individual coaches. Most coaches require 24-48 hours notice for cancellations to receive a refund. Late cancellations may forfeit part or all of the payment. Check your coach's specific policy before booking.",
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},

	// Court Bookings
	{
		id: 25,
		question: 'How do court booking payments work?',
		answer:
			'Court bookings require immediate payment to confirm your reservation. The venue owner receives payment after your booking is completed, minus the platform fee.',
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 26,
		question: 'Do I get charged for no-shows?',
		answer:
			"Yes. If you don't show up for your booking without proper cancellation notice (usually 24 hours), you'll be charged the full amount. Repeated no-shows may result in account restrictions.",
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},

	// Troubleshooting
	{
		id: 27,
		question: "The payment page isn't loading. What should I do?",
		answer:
			'Try these steps: 1) Check your internet connection, 2) Clear your browser cache and cookies, 3) Try a different browser or device, 4) Disable ad blockers or VPN temporarily, 5) Update your app to the latest version. If issues persist, contact support.',
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 28,
		question:
			'I accidentally paid twice. How do I get a refund for the duplicate?',
		answer:
			"Duplicate charges are automatically detected and refunded within 24-48 hours. If you don't see the refund after 3 days, contact support with both transaction IDs, and we'll process a manual refund.",
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 29,
		question: 'Why is the payment amount different from what was advertised?',
		answer:
			'The final amount includes the base price plus our platform fee (2.9% + â‚±15) and any applicable taxes. All fees are clearly displayed at checkout before you confirm payment.',
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 30,
		question: 'Can I update my payment method after booking?',
		answer:
			'Once a booking is confirmed and paid, you cannot change the payment method for that transaction. However, you can update your saved payment methods in your account settings for future bookings.',
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},

	// For Organizers
	{
		id: 31,
		question: 'When do I receive my payment as an organizer/coach?',
		answer:
			'Payments are transferred to your bank account or digital wallet automatically on a weekly or bi-weekly schedule, depending on your settings. You can track pending and completed payouts in your dashboard.',
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
	{
		id: 32,
		question: 'How do I issue a refund to a participant?',
		answer:
			"Go to the specific booking in your organizer dashboard, select 'Issue Refund', choose the refund amount (full or partial), and confirm. The refund will be processed automatically and sent to the participant's original payment method.",
		category: 'Payment Help',
	},
